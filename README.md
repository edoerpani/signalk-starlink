# Signal K Plugin for StarLink

Publishes StarLink Dishy stats (`status`, `latency`, `downlink_throughput`, `uplink_throughput` and `outage` if status is offline) under `network.providers.starlink`.

Proto files are originally sourced from Elias Wilken's [starlink-rs](https://github.com/ewilken/starlink-rs) repo and have been modified.
